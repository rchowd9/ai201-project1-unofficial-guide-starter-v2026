# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in week 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next week costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that
contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
<!-- e.g. "One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so
     I expect that one to be hard." -->

     A couple of questions ask about niche details mentioned in only one sentence, so vector search might occasionally miss, but failing more than once means the retrieval setup isn't working.

---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
<!-- Why all five and not four? What about your setup makes that achievable —
     or what would have to go wrong for it not to be? -->

     Since the file names are in the prompt next to the context, the model has no reason to leave them out.

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate
stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" —
in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
<!-- What did your distances look like when you set the cutoff in Milestone 4?
     Was there a clean gap, or did the two groups overlap? -->

     Off-topic questions can easily share words with travel guides, so catching 4 out of 5 blocks most junk without being so strict that it rejects weirdly worded valid questions.

## 4. Something about your chunks

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE.

     How would you know if your chunks were the right size? Name something
     countable or observable.

     At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks contain complete, readable sentences without getting cut off mid-word or mid-sentence at either boundary.

     Examples of the right shape — don't copy these, they should come from
     what you actually saw in Milestone 3:
       - "At least 4 of 5 sampled chunks read as a complete thought, with no
          sentence cut in half at either end."
       - "No chunk is shorter than 200 characters, since anything below that
          in my corpus turned out to be a heading with no content under it." -->



**Why this target:**

Basic character splitting tends to chop sentences mid-word, so requiring most chunks to end cleanly keeps the model from missing key numbers or cutoff details.

---

## 5. Your choice

<!-- YOU WRITE THIS ONE TOO.

     Pick something you actually care about getting right. It could be about
     speed, about refusals, about a particular kind of question your corpus
     handles badly, about source attribution being correct rather than merely
     present — anything, as long as it names a number or an observable
     outcome. -->

     For 5 out of 5 valid test questions, the generated response correctly attributes facts to the specific source document from which they were retrieved when answering questions about mobility.



**Why this target:**

With multiple guides mentioning things like hospitals or Sunday buses for different towns, giving the right answer with the wrong source filename gives someone flat-out wrong travel advice.

     WEEK 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in week 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
