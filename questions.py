"""
Your test questions.

Milestone 2 asks you to write five questions your system should be able to
answer from your corpus, specific enough to have a right answer.

  ✗ "What are good dining halls?"          — no right answer
  ✓ "What do students say about wait times at Commons during lunch?"

Fill in `QUESTIONS` below. `expects` is a word or short phrase you'd expect a
correct answer to contain — you'll use it in week 2 when you build a scorer,
and having written it now means you decided what "correct" meant before you saw
any results.

`OUT_OF_SCOPE` holds five questions your documents clearly don't cover. You
need these in Milestone 4 to find where your relevance cutoff belongs, and
again in week 2, where `run_eval.py` runs them through the gate and writes what
happened into your run log — that's the evidence for criterion 3.

Swap them for your own if you like. Keep five of them either way: criterion 3
names a target of "4 of 5", and four of three is not a thing.

# Questions from a different world entirely. Your gate should refuse all five.
#
# There are five of these because criterion 3 in criteria.md names a target of
# "at least 4 of 5" — you need five things to try before you can report 4 of 5.
# `run_eval.py` runs these through retrieval and the gate on every eval and
# records what happened, so criterion 3 has evidence in the run log alongside
# the others. They cost no model calls: a refusal never reaches the model.
